TOFIX:

-- the HOUR INDEX thing seems off for the plot

TODO:

-- does it predict better with cross bases
-- or what about decomposed variables (why is decomposed )
-- how much better is the performance in the training period? what about the test period
-- dummy variables in LSTM ?
-- what is the influence of the window period? this is the same as talking about lags
   or the the case-crossover structure
-- what about all the LSTM things: more epochs, different structure of the LSTM,
   different loss function, activation, tuning mechanisms, dropout

PAPER OUTLINE

-- this becomes the "simulation case" of the early methods
-- and then we apply it in OPTUM for the main results
