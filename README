TOFIX:

-- the HOUR INDEX thing seems off for the plot

TODO:

-- does it predict better with cross bases
-- or what about decomposed variables (why is decomposed )
-- how much better is the performance in the training period? what about the test period
-- dummy variables in LSTM ?
-- what is the influence of the window period? this is the same as talking about lags
   or the the case-crossover structure
-- what about all the LSTM things: more epochs, different structure of the LSTM,
   different loss function, activation, tuning mechanisms, dropout

TO THINK ABOUT:

-- we want to talk about prediction vs estimation. and why/when using DLNM-based
estimates for prediction (i.e., gasp's recent paper) would cause you to miss
underestimate etc
-- maybe this isn't a paper, and its a commentary

PAPER OUTLINE

-- this becomes the "simulation case" of the early methods (or maybe a commentary)
-- and then we apply it in OPTUM for the main results
-- difference in magnitude of predicted health impacts using LSTM vs DLNM (vs ARIMA) compared to OPTUM data
